The team G-Revolution is to fight in some time and they are tensed up as someone has kidnapped Kenny from the cafeteria.
They have made a police complaint and the police are searching for Kenny. Luckily, they have found his device with all the data. 
The problem is, the data is present randomly and not in the order they have to fight the opponent. 
Team G-Revolution wants to win at any cost and for that, they need the order in which they have to fight optimally to win the maximum 
number of battles.

A player can win only when his/her beyblade power is strictly greater than the opponents beyblade power.



Example:

Consider the team size is 3, N = 3


The 3 players of both the teams are shown with their beyblade powers.
Team G-Revolution is presented in the order: Tyson, Max, Ray
Team All Starz is presented in the order: Michael, Eddy, Steve

The maximum number of fights Team G-Revolution can win is 2 when they are arranged optimally or fight in an optimal order.



Team G-Revolution needs help with the device. Tyson has heard about your skills and called you up to help them shuffle their 
positions in an order such that they would be able to win the maximum number of fights. Can you help Tyson and Team G-Revolution?
